# Circular Sock Knitting Machine 
In progress port of RKStar42's [OpenSCAD Circular Knitting Machine](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6273014).

There is a long list of parts to port over so far I have completed
* needle drum

## Why do this?
To learn the Fusion 360 API, and also because while I appreciate everything that OpenSCAD is, actually using it is not my cup of tea.

## How to use this
Unzip / clone this somewhere locally. In Fusion 360 go to Utilites > Add Ins > Scripts and Add Ins
Click the green + button and find the folder. Add CSM Generator to Fusion. Click "Run" and wait a minute while everything calculates. Admire the needle drum. 

If you want to see what it's supposed to be doing open up the .scad file and preview the machine.
